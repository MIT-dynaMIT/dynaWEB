#Final Commit
I've tried fixing CSS bugs and I'm basically illiterate at CSS and can't do it for my life.

Backend is complete with mail-sending and all that good stuff. Sid or whoever has to reply to the emails parents send simply have to click reply, since the parents emails are already configured in the "reply-to" header of the message. 

Currently, password is in the repo, so I've temporarily changed the repo to private. When you guys have your own heroku hosted, you can just set the password as a config variable on heroku so that no one can see it. You guys should host the actual website on your own heroku account, mine is already pretty full. The Procfile and whatnot are exactly the same here, so hosting on Heroku with these dependency files should have no issues. 

To see the currently deployed app, check here: https://dynamit.herokuapp.com/
